excerpt: 'As a data science team, our goal is to predict customer churn in an e-commerce setting and provide recommendations to enhance engagement and reduce the churn rate.'

## Metrics:
 To evaluate the success of our model, we will be using two key metrics: customer churn rate and customer satisfaction score. The churn rate will indicate the percentage of customers who have stopped using the platform, while the satisfaction score will reflect the level of customer satisfaction with the platform. By reducing the churn rate and improving the satisfaction score, we aim to increase customer retention and ultimately drive growth for the e-commerce platform.

## Outcome:
The outcome of this project will be a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide recommendations for enhancing customer engagement. The model will be validated using the metrics of customer churn rate and customer satisfaction score, and its results will be used to inform decisions and strategies aimed at reducing customer churn and improving customer satisfaction. By using data-driven insights, we aim to help the e-commerce platform improve its customer retention and drive growth for the business.
