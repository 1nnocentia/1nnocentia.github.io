### What is a Linear Equation in One Variable?

A **linear equation in one variable** is an equation that can be written in the form:

\[
ax + b = 0
\]

Where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and
- \( x \) is the variable.

The solution to such an equation is the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

---

### Examples of Linear Equations in One Variable

1. \( 2x + 5 = 15 \)
2. \( 4x - 7 = 9 \)
3. \( -3x + 8 = 2 \)

---

### Solving Linear Equations in One Variable

To solve a linear equation, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Simplify the Equation**
- Combine like terms on both sides of the equation.

#### **Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
- Use addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

#### **Step 3: Solve**
- Perform the necessary operations to find the value of \( x \).

### Worked Example

Solve the equation:  
\[
3x + 7 = 16
\]

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Simplify the Equation:**  
   Subtract \( 7 \) from both sides:  
   \[
   3x = 16 - 7
   \]  
   \[
   3x = 9
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**  
   Divide both sides by \( 3 \):  
   \[
   3x/3 = 9/3
   \]  
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

#### Final Answer:  
\[
x = 3
\]

### Real-Life Applications of Linear Equations

Linear equations are used in everyday life to solve practical problems, such as:

1. **Budgeting**: Calculating expenses and savings.  
   Example: If you spend \( \$10 \) on food and want to save \( \$50 \), how much must you earn?  
   Solve \( x - 10 = 50 \).

2. **Distance Problems**: Calculating travel distance or time.  
   Example: If a car travels \(60 km/hr), how long does it take to travel \(180 km)?  
   Solve \( 60x = 180 \).

---

### Practice Problems

Try solving these linear equations:

1. \( 5x - 3 = 12 \)  
2. \( 7 + 2x = 17 \)  
3. \( -4x + 8 = 20 \)
