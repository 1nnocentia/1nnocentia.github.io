## Understanding Binary
The **binary system** (base-2) is a way of representing numbers using only two digits: `0` and `1`.

The **decimal system** (base-10) is what we use daily, with digits ranging from `0` to `9`.

To convert a binary number to decimal:
1. Write down the binary number.
2. Assign powers of 2 to each binary digit, starting from 0 on the right.
3. Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2.
4. Add the results.

### **Quick Example: Convert `1011` to Decimal**

Letâ€™s convert the binary number `1011` to decimal using the table below:

| Binary Digit | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Power of 2   | \(2^3\) | \(2^2\) | \(2^1\) | \(2^0\) |
| Value        | 8   | 0   | 2   | 1   |

1. **Step 1**: Write each binary digit and align it with its corresponding power of 2.
   - The leftmost binary digit `1` corresponds to \(2^3 = 8\).
   - The next binary digit `0` corresponds to \(2^2 = 0\).
   - The binary digit `1` corresponds to \(2^1 = 2\).
   - The last binary digit `1` corresponds to \(2^0 = 1\).

2. **Step 2**: Multiply each binary digit by its power of 2:
   \[
   (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
   = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1
   \]

3. **Step 3**: Add the results:
   \[
   8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
   \]

Thus, **`1011` in binary = `11` in decimal**.

|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| `110`   | \(2^2, 2^1, 2^0\)    | \( (1 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1) \) | 6       |
| `1010`  | \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0\)| \( (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1) \) | 10      |
| `1111`  | \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0\)| \( (1 * 8) + (1 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 1) \) | 15      |
