Do you ever code with 8086 Assembly Language? The low language for code. I use online compiler: [find here!](https://yjdoc2.github.io/8086-emulator-web/)

### What I have to know before trying to code with low language?
1. Basic of Registers and Memory
2. Read the Instruction Page
3. Get to know the function run in 8086 Assembly

```
; 8086 Assembly Language
DB 0x2A ;store star (*) in data byte
start:
MOV AH, 0x13 ;print string function
MOV CX, 1 ;length bits to print
MOV DL, 0 ;column positioning
_print:
INT 0x10 ;function for display output
INC DL ;increment DL (we utilize the auto new line)a
INC BL ;init BL = 0, and increase as looping
CMP BL, 3 ;compare if BL = 3 then
JE stop ;jump if equal
JMP _print ;if not, back to _print
stop:
HLT ;stop
```

This code use a bit of trick. The first time I try to run the code (not the code above), it printed downward. So, in this new code, we modificate with column position.
